# Get Ready For An Awesome Adventure!

You start bootcamp soon! We at Learn are getting really excited for you to start, and we hope you are too. We have lots of great stuff planned, so we put together this list of things you can do to be ready for day 1. We'll be adding new challenges to this repo every week.

### 1. Create a github account

If you don't have one already, sign up for a github account! Git is an awesome technology that allows you to save and share your progress as you write code, colloborate with other developers on a project, and organize your progress on a project. Github is the online platform we will use to interact with Git.

Once you've completed it -- share it with your future classmates! Post in your Learn class slack channel that you completed the git challenge.
