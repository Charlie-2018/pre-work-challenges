# Your First Project -- CREATE A WEBPAGE!

Only one week left until you start bootcamp!! We hope that you are feeling as excited as we are. Your first day at Learn will be an orientation day, so we won't do a lot of code, but after that we'll be jumping straight into Javascript. 

Now that you've had the chance to get familiar with git and had some HTML and CSS under your fingers, try them out! Time to get yourself into a coding frame of mind by building a web page. Use what you learned so far about HTML, CSS, and github to create a profile page.

## THE CHALLENGE:

#### STEP 1. With HTML and CSS, build a webpage that could serve as your single page profile website.
- Your page should have two files, one .html file, and one .css file. 

#### STEP 2: Add your project to Github
- If you don't have a github account yet -- create one! We will be using github all throughout the course, so the more comfortable you are with git, the better. 
- With your github account now setup, experiment with creating a new repository and adding your profile page code to it. If you have any questions, use your class slack channel!
- Once you have your code in a repository on github, post the link to your code in the slack channel!
- If you need a refresher on using git and github, do this tutorial: <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git"> Try Git</a>

Thought Starters: You could put up a picture of you, a paragraph about why you want to learn code, a list of past work experience or your crazy hobbies or pets. Really - you can do what you want with your profile page. If you are having trouble figuring out how you want the page to look, draw the layout on paper first, or take a look on theme forest or any websites you like, and try to reproduce what they've done. There's ton's of inspiration out there!
