# Start With the Basics

We want to use your time in class as efficiently as possible, so we expect that you know the basics of HTML and CSS when you start class. To get ramped up on the basics of these two essential web technologies quickly, sign up for a codecademy account and try some of the HTML classes. They are short, fun, and a great way to prepare for the class.

If you don't know where to start, try this one: <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html">Learn HTML</a>

## Celebrate!
Once you've completed the Learn HTML course from codecademy -- celebrate it!! Celebrating the wins will be incredibly important as you start the process of learning to program.
 
And let us celebrate with you! Post your accomplishment in the class slack channel. It will help encourage your future classmates to do the same. You can also get help by asking questions in your class channel, where an instructor will see your message and respond.
