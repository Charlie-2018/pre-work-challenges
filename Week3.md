# Javascript Intro

Javascript is a programming language that is increasingly popular and important in web development. When you get to bootcamp, the first 3 weeks of class we will jump right in to learning Javasript and React - a popular javascript library. 

It will be very helpful to have seen a little bit of Javascript before you start, so this week we are going to go over a few resources to help you get started. 

Both the resources we have already used (Codecademy and Free Code Camp) have Javascript lessons available.

If you don't know where to start, try this lesson from Codecademy: <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript">Introduction To JavaScript</a>
