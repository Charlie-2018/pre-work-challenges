# More to Explore

We have just started to scratch the surface of what we can do with HTML and CSS. Last week we used Codecademy as a resource to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. You will find that in web development, there is always something new to learn, and finding the right online tutorials, articles, and documentation is paramount to your success.

This week, we are going to explore another resource that will be helpful in getting you a strong start for this bootcamp: <a href="www.freecodecamp.org">Free Code Camp</a>

Free Code Camp has a ton of interactive tutorials. Sign up for a free account and go through some of the HTML/CSS lessons.

Share your progress and see how far you and your classmates can get in the free code camp challenges.
